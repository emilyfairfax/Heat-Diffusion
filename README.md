# Heat-Diffusion
 <p> Since I was not in class for week 1 & 2, I just wrote a 1D heat diffusion model today.</p>
 <p>There are two codes: </p>
 <p>1) HeatDiffusion1D.m, a simple heat diffusion that includes a Chi-Squared value calculated at the end. </p>
 <p>2) HeatDiffusion1DParameterOptimization.m, a 1D heat diffusion where the script optimizes the parameters for the new "hot" surface temperature, and the time since the step change occured. It runs according to minumum and maximum values for each parameter, and the number of runs in each parameter space as defined by the user. At the end of the optimization portion, the script creates an animation of the heat diffusion problem using the best parameters. Note that the best parameters are printed to the console.</p>
